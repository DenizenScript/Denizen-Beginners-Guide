### Notes / Rules

- Sub-headings in files must always be at least 3 hash symbols (that is, `###`). This means, NEVER use `##` or `#`. One or two will be considered a main heading and find their way into the global table-of-contents where they don't belong.
- The name of a command used in text should always have \`backticks\` around it, so it appears like `this`.
- Parenthetical note should be written with the `parens` span ... that is, they should look like this: `This foodTM is delicious *and* good for you! <span class="parens">(claims not verified by doctor, foodTM contains 4000 calories)</span>.`
