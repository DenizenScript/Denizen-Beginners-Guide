Expanding Beyond Just Minecraft
-------------------------------

Denizen is made for Minecraft servers and as such is only really designed to work with Minecraft servers. However, your Minecraft server as a project and a community probably extends beyond just the core Minecraft server itself - you might have a Discord group, a website, a Bungee network connecting multiple servers, ...

This section contains guides on how to integrate your Denizen scripts running on your core Minecraft server with these expanded outside parts of your project.

If you're wondering whether you need to look through these: they're not really needed to understand Denizen, but you might choose to look at the pages relating to things you use, or just skim through to look for ideas that might improve your server and its community.
