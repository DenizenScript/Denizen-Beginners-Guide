Finding The Right Tool For The Script (PLACEHOLDER ONLY)
-------------------------------------

**TODO: Write-up that explains how to find the correct command/event/tag/... for a script. Should emphasize the `#bot-spam` channel on the Discord and the idea of asking other people for help in `#denizen`, though also mention the meta docs website.**
NOTE: Probably a good place to mention the sheer massive number of things that Denizen supports (check the output of `!reload`).

### Placeholder

Until this page is written, you can view the [old tutorial video here](https://one.denizenscript.com/denizen/vids/Getting%20Help).
