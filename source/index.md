Denizen Beginner's Guide
------------------------

A guide for new users of [Denizen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/denizen.21039/)!

If you're not familiar with Denizen, check out the [Background](/guides/background/index) section.

If you're not sure if learning Denizen is for you, check out the [New Users FAQ](/guides/background/new-user-faq) page, which will answer common questions for uncertain new users.

When you're ready to get started, open the [First Steps](/guides/first-steps/index) section, and follow the guide page by page through to the end of the basics section (note: FOLLOW, not read. Try the example scripts yourself and play with the ideas you learn!).

**WARNING:** This guide is very much still a work in progress, several pages are placeholdered with older tutorial videos.
