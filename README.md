### Installation

You must use `pip` to install the packages listed in `requirements.txt` (via `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

### Building

After Sphinx is installed, you can build by running `sphinx-build -ab html source/ build/`

This will create a fully built static web pages folder in `build/`.
